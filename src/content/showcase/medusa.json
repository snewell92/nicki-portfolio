  "story": "The story of Medusa was always sad to me, her fate determined by a petty man, reduced to a monster when she scorned Poseidon. To me this often makes me think of being a woman in the patriarchy, how we are reduced by the male gaze and when we push back we're deemed a b*tch or 'monster'. I wanted to draw Medusa as beautiful and alluring even in her 'monstrous' state because I think sometimes for us as women when we embrace that the patriarchy has made us out to be monsters there is almost some power in that because it means that deep down they are afraid of us and what we stand to gain in our strength.",
